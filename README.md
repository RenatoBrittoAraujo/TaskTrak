# TaskTrak
Simple task tracker android and IOS app.

I started this out just to learn react native, but this app actually became use to me.
Who could have guessed that an annoying constant remainder of things that I am yet to
do would acutally prove itself so useful.

As you can see, there are two types of task, the ones we do frequently and the ones we
only do once. These two can be tracked in the app.

Forewarning: If you have any tasks not done, this app will spam your notifications
constatly about it.

The design is dead simple (and ugly!), take a look:
